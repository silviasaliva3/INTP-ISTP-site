    <h1>Differences Between INTPs and ISTPs</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> INTPs and ISTPs share their first and fourth functions, making them appear quite similar to the untrained eye. However, 
      the differences in their second and third functions account for the uniqueness of the INTP and ISTP. </p>

      <h2>The Second Function: Ne vs Se</h2>
      <p> INTPs and ISTPs use their shared Ti filter on their second function, which is either Ne in the INTPs case, or Se in the ISTPs case. INTP are
        more drawn to analyzing <strong> ideas </strong> (Ne), and ISTPs prefer to analyze <strong> concrete events </strong> (Se). Due to their Se, ISTPs will be much more aware of their
        physical surroundings than INTPs.
        
      </p>

      <h2>The Third Function: Si vs. Ni</h2>
      <p>INTPs will generally be more concerned with <strong> analyzing the past</strong> (Si), while ISTPs will think more deeply about <strong> planning the future </strong> (Ni).
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      While INTPs and ISTPs are quite similar, their key differences can be found by analyzing their second and third functions.
